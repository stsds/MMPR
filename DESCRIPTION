Description: Provides new data-structure support for multi- and mixed-precision for R users.The package supports 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit operations with the ability to perform mixed-precision operations through a newly defined tile-based data structure.To the best of our knowledge, 'MPCR' differs from the currently available packages in the following:'MPCR' introduces a new data structure that supports three different precisions (16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit), allowing for optimized memory allocation based on the desired precision. This feature offers significant advantages in-memory optimization. 'MPCR' extends support to all basic linear algebra methods across different precisions. 'MPCR' maintains a consistent interface with normal R functions, allowing for seamless code integration and a user-friendly experience. 'MPCR' also introduces support for the tile-based matrix data structure with mixed precision, enabling the utilization of a range of tile-based linear algebra algorithms.
